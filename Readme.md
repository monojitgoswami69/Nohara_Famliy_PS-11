# CodeCollab

**Real-time collaborative code editor built for teams.**

CodeCollab is a browser-based collaborative coding platform that allows multiple developers to write, edit, and review code together in real time. It pairs a feature-rich Monaco editor frontend with a purpose-built WebSocket collaboration server, delivering sub-second synchronization with conflict-free concurrent editing powered by Yjs CRDTs.

## Platform Overview

CodeCollab addresses the need for lightweight, zero-install collaborative coding environments. Unlike heavyweight IDE extensions or cloud workspaces that require account setup and infrastructure provisioning, CodeCollab runs entirely in the browser. A host creates a room, shares a six-character room code, and collaborators join instantly.

The platform is designed around three principles:

1. **Conflict-free real-time editing.** All document synchronization uses Yjs, a CRDT-based framework that guarantees eventual consistency without a central authority or operational transforms. Every keystroke propagates to all peers within milliseconds.

2. **Minimal infrastructure footprint.** The collaboration server is a single stateless Node.js process with no database dependency. Room state, document trees, and cursor awareness all live in memory for the duration of a session. This makes the system trivially deployable on any VPS, container platform, or serverless edge runtime.

3. **Production-grade editor experience.** The editor surface is Monaco (the engine behind VS Code), providing syntax highlighting for 50+ languages, IntelliSense, bracket pair colorization, minimap navigation, and full keyboard shortcut support out of the box.

## Architecture

CodeCollab follows a three-tier service architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Dual WebSocket Channel Design

The socket server exposes two distinct WebSocket paths per room:

| Path | Protocol | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `/room/:roomId` | JSON | Control channel for room management, join/approve workflows, file sharing metadata, and chat messages |
| `/doc/:roomId/:fileId` | Binary (Yjs) | Document synchronization channel carrying Yjs sync and awareness protocol messages |

This separation ensures that heavy binary document traffic (sync vectors, state updates) never competes with lightweight JSON control messages on the same channel. Each shared file gets its own `Y.Doc` instance on the server, allowing independent synchronization lifecycles.

### Conflict Resolution

All concurrent edits are resolved using Yjs CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types). Unlike Operational Transform (OT) systems that require a central server to serialize operations, CRDTs allow every peer to apply operations in any order and converge to the same state deterministically. This eliminates the need for server-side conflict resolution logic entirely.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- Python 3.10 or later
- A GitHub OAuth App (for repository import functionality)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/monojitgoswami69/Nohara_Famliy_PS-11.git
cd Nohara_Famliy_PS-11
```

### 2. Start the REST Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env            # Edit .env with your GitHub OAuth credentials
python main.py
```

The API server starts on `http://localhost:8000` by default.

### 3. Start the Collaboration Server

```bash
cd backend-socket
npm install
npm start
```

The WebSocket server starts on `http://localhost:4000` by default.

### 4. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server starts on `http://localhost:3000` (or the next available port).
